# Tips and Tricks

## Prerequisites

Bellow are the key concepts required to work with KMDC efficiently:

* Familiarity with [compose-web].
* Familiarity with [Kotlin/JS interop][kjs-interop]
* Familiarity with [MDC architecture][mdc-architecture]
* Familiarity with [Integrating MDC Web into Frameworks][mdc-framework-integration]

## How to create a KMDC wrapper

> _MDC component_ refers to the [material-components-web] framework ui.
> A _KMDC component_ is a Kotlin wrapper for an MDC ui.

Before starting, here are some general pointers about MDC & KMDC architecture:

* Each MDC ui lives in a separate KMDC [module](../lib).
* Some MDC components depend on CSS, which needs to be imported for it to function properly.
* Inlining CSS imports does not prevent end-users from using SCSS if they so choose.
* Most MDC components have a companion JS adaptor, which needs to be initialised and disposed together with wrapping
  a composable.
* Each KMDC ui has (in the following order)
    1. a custom dedicated primitive argument (e.g. `checked` argument for [MDCCheckbox.kt]) â€“ only if absolutely
       required,
    2. a KMDC ui options builder (`opts`),
    3. the usual [compose-web] attribute builders (`attrs` & `content`).
* KMDC ui options feature the same builder-theme design as attributes.

### Basics

#### Auto-importing a CSS module

Most MDC components depend on some CSS to function properly. To make the end-user experience smoother, KMDC auto-imports
such CSS where needed and hides this fact from the consumers.

First, you need to create a reference to appropriate CSS module.

```kotlin
@JsModule("@material/checkbox/dist/mdc.checkbox.css") // 1
external val MDCCheckboxStyle: dynamic // 2
```

1. Tells the Kotlin compiler that the following declaration refers to a JS module and should use the JS native module
   resolver.
   This is further picked up by webpack CSS loader to eventually inline the CSS module into the final JS executable.
2. Declares the Kotlin reference to it as `external` value with `dynamic` type, since we only need to know the reference
   and not the type.

Once you have a reference to it, you need to make sure that DCE does not remove it. This is done by holding a static
reference in a top-level composable.

```kotlin
@Composable fun MDCCheckbox() {
  MDCCheckboxStyle
  // Rest of the composition logic
}
```

#### Initialising and Disposing a JS Adapter

Most of the MDC components also depend on JS adaptors that need to be initialised and disposed together with the
underlying HTML ui's lifecycle. In such cases, Kotlin needs to know about its MDC JS interface and types to be
able
to use them from compose context.

Firstly, declare the external JS module

```kotlin
@JsModule("@material/checkbox") // 1
external object MDCCheckboxModule { // 2
  class MDCCheckbox(element: Element) : MDCFormFieldModule.MDCFormFieldInput { // 3
    companion object {
      fun attachTo(element: Element): MDCCheckbox // 4
    }
    
    fun destroy() // 5
    var checked: Boolean // 6
    override val ripple: MDCRippleModule.MDCRipple? // 7
  }
}
```

1. Tells Kotlin compiler that the following declaration refers to a JS module and should use the JS native module
   resolver.
2. Declares a container for the entire JS module as an `external` object. All declarations inside will be mapped 1:1 to
   the JS module's `module.exports` or cumulative list of es6 `export` statements. The declarations are read from the
   entry file declared in npm package's `package.json#main`field, since we do not specify further path from base module
   name (`@material/checkbox`) in #1.
3. Declares a `class` with a constructor from the external module, that extends another external class.
4. Declares a `static method` that can be used without an instance of this class.
5. Declares a `method` of this class.
6. Declares a mutable `property` property of this class.
7. Declares a `method override` that this class has, which comes from its super class.

When you have the external declarations ready, you can start using them to implement an adapter lifecycle into your
composables. This is done via the `ref` and `ref::onDispose` helper functions inside the `attrs` builder. These give you
direct
access to the underlying HTML ui.

```kotlin
@Composable
fun MDCCheckbox() {
  Div(attrs = {
    ref { // 1
      val mdc = MDCCheckboxModule.MDCCheckbox.attachTo(it) // 2
      it.mdc = mdc // 3
      onDispose { // 4
        it.mdc<MDCCheckboxModule.MDCCheckbox> { destroy() } // 5
      }
    }
  }) {
    // Composable content
  }
}
```

1. Invokes the `ref` block, which gives us access to the underlying HTML element as an `it` implicit argument.
2. Uses the reference to the HTML element to initialise the appropriate MDC adapter using its static `attachTo` method.
   This can
   also be done by invoking the constructor. Both ways return a reference to the initialised adaptor which you need to
   store.
3. Uses KMDC utility extensions to store the adaptor reference as a new `mdc` property under HTML element.
4. Registers a disposal hook, which will be invoked when the composable leaves the composition.
5. Uses yet another KMDC utility extension, to execute `MDCCheckbox::destroy` if the HTMLElement has an appropriate mdc
   adaptor attached to it.

### Flow

1. Pick an MDC ui to wrap and familiarize yourself with its interface.
    * Read the MDC ui's README (e.g.: [mdc-checkbox]) to understand how its HTML works.
    * Check out the MDC ui's Typescript/JavaScript interface to understand how its underlying JS control works.
2. Create the KMDC ui. See [MDCCheckbox.kt] for an example.
    1. Create new `kmdc-` module in [../lib]
    2. Create a wrapper for top-level MDC ui
        1. If needed, declare the MDC ui's CSS module and reference it in KMDC's main composable function.
        2. If needed, declare a JS external module for the MDC ui adapter and use it to initialise and dispose
           composable HTML ref.
        3. If needed, create wrappers for your chosen module's MDC subcomponents.
    3. Create a new `Samples` file in [../sandbox/src/jsMain/kotlin/samples] to render and test your composable in
       action!
